Set up authentication credentials. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the IAM Console. You can create or use an existing user. Go to manage access keys and generate a new set of keys.

If you have the AWS CLI installed, then you can use it to configure your credentials file:

aws configure
Alternatively, you can create the credential file yourself. By default, its location is at ~/.aws/credentials:

[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
You may also want to set a default region. This can be done in the configuration file. By default, its location is at ~/.aws/config:

[default]
region=us-east-1


import boto3

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
